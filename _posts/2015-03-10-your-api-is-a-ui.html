This month we're excited to welcome <strong>Chris Hoult<&#47;strong> (<a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;choult">@choult<&#47;a>), presenting on "<strong>Your API is a UI<&#47;strong>"<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you're creating a complex web application or a simple library, everything you create has a user. Why, then, do we concentrate on our users when developing a user interface, but so often forget them when developing APIs? In this talk, Christopher presents a whirlwind overview of a variety of different User Experience considerations when designing your APIs.<&#47;blockquote></p>
