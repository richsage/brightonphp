<blockquote><p>The entity system in Drupal is incredibly powerful and is how nodes, taxonomy terms and users in Drupal core are built. &nbsp;But what if our data or functionality doesn't coincide with an existing entity type and we need a way to create custom entities, forms and ways to manage those entities? &nbsp; The Entity Construction Kit (ECK) allows us to stop shoving all of our data into nodes, and quickly create custom entities to handle our specific use cases through the Drupal UI.</p>
<p>Let's talk a bit about what ECK can do, when you should use it and why you should use it.<&#47;blockquote></p>

<p>Jeni&nbsp;Tehan&nbsp;is web developer and director of Delicious Creative in Brighton and has been a Drupal specialist for the past seven years.<br />
