<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;09&#47;emmanuel.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;09&#47;emmanuel.jpg" alt="Emmanuel Ide" class="alignright" width="150" height="150" &#47;><&#47;a>This month&#39;s meeting will take place on Monday 15th August, 7pm for 7.15pm start, at The Skiff in Brighton as usual. This month we welcome <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;galide" target="_blank"><strong>Emmanuel Ide<&#47;strong><&#47;a> back to speak, and he&#39;ll be presenting a case study on "<strong>User management as a service<&#47;strong>", illustrating the use of the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;stormpath.com" target="_blank">Stormpath<&#47;a> PHP SDK to integrate user management into your applications. From the Stormpath website:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stormpath is the first user management and authentication service for developers. A scalable cloud-based API, Stormpath provides a common role-based access control &amp; authentication framework that can be used across disparate applications and multiple programming languages. It also provides an on-line management console and workflows for user registration and password recovery.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Stormpath virtualizes your user stores to simplify access to multiple directories from one application. Groups and roles reflect user roles and organizations, including SaaS directories, and are easy for any admin to manage. Directories, accounts, and groups are available to any connected application via our web console or REST +JSON API. Authentication occurs instantly with one simple API call.<&#47;p><br />

And see you there! :-)<&#47;p></p>
