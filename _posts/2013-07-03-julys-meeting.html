<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;07&#47;IMG_3803.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;07&#47;IMG_3803-150x150.jpg" alt="Alick Mighall" class="alignright" &#47;><&#47;a>Thanks to those of you that came to last month's social event! This month we welcome Alick Mighall from Brighton-based web agency <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.miggle.co.uk&#47;" title="Miggle">Miggle<&#47;a>. Alick's presentation is titled <strong>"Why use a framework?"<&#47;strong><&#47;p></p>
<p>Alick Mighall has been working as a digital producer since 1994.<&#47;p></p>
<p>He is currently MD of miggle.co.uk, a Brighton based web agency which he founded in 2007, after seven years' international and board level experience at Yahoo!<&#47;p></p>
<p>Miggle's success has largely been driven by the fact that it understands web audiences. Everyday, millions of UK Internet users engage with content that has been created by, or sites that have been planned and built by the team.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Alick's talk looks at why and how miggle.co.uk have made the choices they have around using open source content management systems and frameworks &ndash; in particular Drupal.<&#47;p></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delivered from a Product Manager's perspective and should be relevant to anyone who's thinking of moving away from a proprietary approach to web development.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The venue is as usual <a href="http:&#47;&#47;theskiff.org&#47;">The Skiff<&#47;a>. Arrive 7pm for a 7.15pm kickoff.  Please let us know over at the event listing on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lanyrd.com&#47;2013&#47;brightonphp-july&#47;">Lanyrd<&#47;a> if you're thinking of coming!<&#47;p></p>
