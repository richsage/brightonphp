<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;10&#47;jase.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;10&#47;jase-125x150.jpg" alt="jase" class="alignright" &#47;><&#47;a>This month's talk is presented by Jason Bailey, and is on <strong>Finding patterns in Google Analytics with PHP<&#47;strong>.Jason will present methods of crunching big data from Google Analytics via PHP, and visualising it with d3.js afterwards.<&#47;p></p>
<p><strong>Bio:<&#47;strong> Jason Bailey is a web developer at the University of Sussex. Jason works on web applications for students and staff at the university. Jason is a slightly obsessive fan of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.popwilleatitself.net">Pop Will Eat Itself<&#47;a> and will attempt to mention them in any conversation. Jason likes tinkering with data. Jason's interests include cinema, reading and looking pensive on a new chair which matches the sofa.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>As usual, the talk will start at 7.15pm.  Following the talk we'll head to the pub.  This month is also the 1 year anniversary of BrightonPHP, so there'll be cake as well!<&#47;p></p>
<p>If you're thinking of coming, please mark yourself as attending over on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lanyrd.com&#47;2013&#47;brightonphp-october&#47;">Lanyrd event page<&#47;a><&#47;p></p>
