<p>Happy new year!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;01&#47;simon-holywell.jpg"><img class="alignright" alt="Simon Holywell" src="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;01&#47;simon-holywell-150x150.jpg" &#47;><&#47;a>Hope everyone had a lovely festive period. We kick off BrightonPHP in 2014 welcoming Brighton developer <strong>Simon Holywell<&#47;strong>, who will be presenting on <strong>Functional Programming in PHP<&#47;strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the PHP world functions are generally sneered at due to their simplicity and perceived as an evil side effect of spaghetti code. This is not necessarily the case however as when functions are combined in a logical manner they can be very powerful.</p>
<p>In fact they can be deployed to great effect in all manner of applications to create advanced and potentially less error prone software. This talk will take the form of a gentle introduction to functional programming concepts in a PHP context.</p>
<p>It will cater to a variety of levels of knowledge. Right from those who have never heard of functional programming to coders who have been practicing aspects for years in other languages (JavaScript!) - perhaps without even knowing.</p>
<p>During my talk you'll hear some history, functional theory (introduced gently I promise) and of course some practical examples. You definitely do not need to be a mathematician or expert&#47;functional coder to enjoy this session.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Simon's biography:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>My name is Simon Holywell and I am an Australian Zend certified lead developer working at Mosaic in Brighton. Previously I have worked in London, Melbourne and Auckland for web development firms.</p>
<p>Currently, I am nearly complete with a book about functional programming in the PHP language. For more information see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.functionalphp.com&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.functionalphp.com&#47;<&#47;a></p>
<p>I have a blog (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;simonholywell.com">simonholywell.com<&#47;a>) and twitter (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;Treffynnon">@Treffynnon<&#47;a>) where you can keep up to date with my exploits.</p>
<p>I live on the south coast of England with my wife, children and a dog. I am also a big fan of motorcycles although I am in-between bikes at the moment.<&#47;blockquote><br />
As always, please do sign up over on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lanyrd.com&#47;2014&#47;brightonphp-january&#47;">Lanyrd event<&#47;a>, and also over at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;joind.in&#47;event&#47;view&#47;1721">this month's event on joind.in<&#47;a>. Feedback is always welcomed - both on the talks and on the meetup in general!</p>
<p>This month we've also got 3 copies of the e-book "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.packtpub.com&#47;simple-botting-with-php&#47;book">Simple Botting with PHP<&#47;a>" to give away, courtesy of BrightonPHP stalwart Andrew Collington.</p>
<p>See you there :-)</p>
