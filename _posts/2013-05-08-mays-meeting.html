<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;05&#47;lars-janssen.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;05&#47;lars-janssen-150x150.jpg" alt="Lars Janssen" class="alignright" &#47;><&#47;a>This month we welcome <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;fazy">Lars Janssen<&#47;a> to present. Lars is a new member to the group, and his talk will be on <strong>"Introduction to the Symfony Content Management Framework"<&#47;strong> - abstract as follows:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to content management systems, one size definitely doesn't fit all. The Symfony CMF provides building blocks to add CMS functionality to your own project. Not only for users of the Symfony framework, this talk will give you an update on the project's progress towards its first stable release, and show the many ways in which it can be used.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Lars is currently a software architect working at the conference calling provider, Powwownow, and has been using the Symfony 2 framework for around 9 months. Prior to that he worked for a mobile agency in London on a variety of projects for well-known brands.<&#47;p></p>
<p>As usual, following the talk we'll head to the pub.  If you're thinking of coming, please let us know over at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lanyrd.com&#47;2013&#47;brightonphp-may&#47;">Lanyrd<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Last month we welcomed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;derickr">Derick Rethans<&#47;a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.10gen.com&#47;">10gen<&#47;a> to the group, to present an introduction and some more advanced concepts on MongoDB.  Derick is probably best known in the PHP community for contributing <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.xdebug.org&#47;">Xdebug<&#47;a> to the community, and currently works at 10gen on their PHP driver for MongoDB.  Derick gave a great overview to start with on MongoDB, its applications and uses, and then demonstrated the many features that the NoSQL solution has to offer.  Following the meeting, we headed to the pub where the first round of drinks was generously sponsored by 10gen - thanks!<&#47;p></p>
<p>Slides are available from Derick's talk over on his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;derickrethans.nl&#47;talks&#47;mongo-brighton13">site<&#47;a>.  There's also a video - details to follow shortly when I've finished editing it :-)<&#47;p></p>
