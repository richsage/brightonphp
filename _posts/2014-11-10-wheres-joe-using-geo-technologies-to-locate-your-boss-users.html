<blockquote><p>
Joe Hoyles is the CTO of Human Made, and he is a busy man. He is constantly on the move, which is a problem when you want to catch him for a chat or meeting.<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
<p>In this talk we will look at how we can harness technologies such as GeoIP and Geolocation to keep track of him. I will be sharing how we created a WordPress plugin that integrated Foursquare and GeoIP into an internal site, the quirks and pitfalls of these technologies and issues that have to be considered before trying to store timezones.<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
<p>This session is aimed at developers who want to gain some insight into dealing with Geolocations, GeoIP and timezones. I will be sharing the problems and solutions I encountered when trying to make Joe easier to find.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>We're also excited this month to welcome <a href="http:&#47;&#47;electricputty.co.uk">Electric Putty<&#47;a>, a web agency based in Hove, who are this month's sponsors and providers of beer!
