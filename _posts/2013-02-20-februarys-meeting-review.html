<p>On 18th February, BrightonPHP and <a title="Drupal Brighton" href="http:&#47;&#47;groups.drupal.org&#47;brighton">Drupal Brighton<&#47;a> joined forces and met at <a title="The Skiff" href="http:&#47;&#47;theskiff.org&#47;">The Skiff<&#47;a> for an evening of Drupal-based presentations. Since we both meet on the same night around 200 yards away from each other, it seemed a natural thing to combine forces for one night!<&#47;p></p>
<p><a title="Twitter - Steve Purkiss" href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;stevepurkiss">Steve Purkiss<&#47;a> got things off to a great start with a brief history of the Drupal project, some history about Drupal Brighton and a good overview of Drupal for those perhaps not so familiar with it. <a title="Twitter - Jeni Tehan" href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;DelishCreative">Jeni Tehan<&#47;a> then took over the baton and demonstrated the power and flexibility of Drupal with a few clicks of the mouse, creating a backend for an example music review site. Jeni presents the "Tasty Backend" series of talks at various Drupal conferences, and it was great to see some real-world examples of Drupal in action and how easy it can be to get a basic management area up and running quickly.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Following the presentations, much discussion ensued, with the evening ending at the <a title="The North Laine" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.drinkinbrighton.co.uk&#47;north-laine">North Laine<&#47;a> for drinks and further discussion.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Hopefully this can be the first of many collaborations with Drupal Brighton - thanks for coming along!<&#47;p></p>
<p>Our next meeting is on <strong>Monday 18th March 2013<&#47;strong>, 7pm for a 7.15pm start<&#47;p></p>
