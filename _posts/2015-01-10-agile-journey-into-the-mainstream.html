<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;Brian_photo.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;Brian_photo.jpg" width="150" alt="Brian_photo" class="alignright" &#47;><&#47;a>Happy new year everybody! We kick off 2015 with a non-PHP related talk but one about a topic that is probably familiar to a large number of developers - agile project management. This month we welcome <strong>Brian Askew<&#47;strong> to speak to us on <strong>"Agile: Journey into the Mainstream..."<&#47;strong>:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>Agile is a term that is increasingly being used in both project approaches and as a skills requirement in job advertisements, but what exactly is it? Are the common perceptions of Agile accurate? In this talk, we will seek to increase the understanding of Agile in contrast to waterfall, look at its development, and provide an overview of its key concepts, behaviours, techniques and most well-known methods (incl. Scrum, Kanban, XP, DSDM, SAFe, Lean, FDD) We will also examine where Agile can be used as well as its benefits, risks and problems. Finally, we will consider Agile&rsquo;s next step into the mainstream, following the announcement that it is to be formally integrated into a well-established Project Management method.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Brian has worked in IT development for 40 years, his career encompassing developer, analyst, designer, trainer, consultant, management and IT Director roles at a wide variety of business types and sectors, ranging from small software start ups to large corporates within Airline, Intellectual Property, Logistics, Supply Chain, Telco and Energy segments. His experience includes 20 years in Programme&#47;Portfolio&#47;Project Management roles delivering IT solutions across the full SDLC using both agile and waterfall software delivery methods. He is particularly interested in improving delivery performance and effectiveness through the use of Agile disciplines in business management as well as software development .<&#47;p></p>
