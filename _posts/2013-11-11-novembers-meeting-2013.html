<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;11&#47;James.png"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;brightonphp.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;11&#47;James-150x150.png" alt="James Titcumb" class="alignright" &#47;><&#47;a>Thanks to those of you that came to last month's talk! This month's talk is by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;asgrim">James Titcumb<&#47;a>, on "<strong>Low Latency Logging<&#47;strong>":<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>Logging is an absolute must for any API or web application, but when starting out, questions such as "how can we do it without disrupting everything else" and "what is the easiest way to log" often come out. I'm going to explore a couple of infrastructure ideas to carry out what I call "high-performance, low-latency" logging to ensure minimal impact to the performance of the runtime application. The talk will show you that a really great logging architecture is a low-cost investment in your application that will definitely pay off in the long run.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Speaker bio:<&#47;strong> I've been doing coding since I got an Amiga 500 and got to grips with my first AmigaBASIC program. Eventually I moved into the wonderful world of the PC and eventually the internet, where I started coding with CGI, Perl and ultimately PHP. PHP struck a chord with me and I've been doing it for the past 11 years (circa PHP 4.1 era). Fast forward to today, I'm the Development Manager at Protected.co.uk and I also run the PHP Hampshire user group, based in Portsmouth. I also dabble in open source projects, currently the Browscap Project (Browser Capabilities Project).<&#47;p></p>
<p>As usual following the presentation we'll head to the North Laine brewery&#47;pub around the corner for a drink.</p>
