<p>Last Monday we had the inaugural meeting of BrightonPHP, which was held at the Friends Centre. It was great to get so many people at the first meeting, and we had a useful 45 minutes or so discussing the approach and format of future meetings, the venue, publicity channels and so on. &nbsp;Following the meeting, we adjourned to a nearby pub where much conversation ensued!</p>
<p>The key points from this meeting:</p>
<h2>Venue<&#47;h2></p>
<p>Friends Centre - possibly a bit out of the way&#47;hard to find, despite its central location. &nbsp;The Skiff was suggested - looks like we've got a slot there now, but are presently waiting for confirmation that someone can lock up for us afterwards! Any Skiff Mates that are keyholders and are interested in coming to the next meeting, please <a href="mailto:rich@brightonphp.org">get in touch<&#47;a>...</p>
<h2>Date&#47;time<&#47;h2></p>
<p>The 3rd Monday of the month at 7pm seemed to suit everyone present, so we'll run with that. &nbsp;Therefore the next meeting will be <strong>Monday 19th November, 7pm<&#47;strong> at The Skiff. &nbsp;Full details to be confirmed once the keyholder issue is resolved; sign up to the mailing list or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;brightonphp">follow us<&#47;a> on Twitter to get confirmation.</p>
<h2>Publicity<&#47;h2></p>
<p>The existing channels for publicising the group were the mailing list, Twitter, the BNM list and to a lesser extend, Lanyrd. &nbsp;I'm going to try and get it on Wired Sussex, Meetup.com and the php.net site (who were a bit slow in publishing the last one) as well.</p>
<h2>Format and "What People Want"<&#47;h2></p>
<p>The usual user group format seemed fine to everyone - presentation, Q&amp;A, relocate to social venue or similar. &nbsp;Same for what people want really - socialising, learning about new technologies and other topics that would be of interest and so on.</p>
