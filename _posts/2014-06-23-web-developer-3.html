<p><strong>Supplied by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.message.co.uk&#47;">Message<&#47;a><&#47;strong></p>
<h2>Job Description:<&#47;h2></p>
<p>We are looking for an experienced developer to work in our spacious offices in central Brighton. The role will focus on backend development using primarily PHP and MySQL.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The team is using lots of new and interesting technologies, such as dependency management with Composer; a bunch of Symfony 2 components; Vagrant for virtualization; one-line deployments and continuous integration.<&#47;p></p>
<p>A core part of the role will be developing our powerful e-commerce platform using brand new code and exciting new technologies.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The successful candidate will have:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience using object-orientated PHP 5 and MySQL queries<&#47;li>
<li>Solid HTML skills and an understanding of semantic mark-up<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Our values<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>We really care about quality, not only of what the client can see, but also the code we have to work with. Everything we produce is peer reviewed. We find that these code and functionality reviews are a great way of sharing knowledge and pushing up the standard. GitHub's pull requests system is integral to the way we work.<&#47;li>
<li>We believe in automation; deploying our code using a one line command. Everything is handled automatically and if something goes wrong it's just one more command to roll back.<&#47;li>
<li>We believe in documenting our code well, so another developers can easily understand it next year, and new developers can quickly orient themselves.<&#47;li>
<li>We believe in writing tests for our code, so we can safely refactor it when we find ways to make it better; and we can keep technical debt at bay.<&#47;li>
<li>We believe in modularising our code by writing small independent libraries that can be easily swapped out, and which, when combined, form a complete system. (We use Composer&#47;Satis to manage these). No behemoth spaghetti-code here.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
