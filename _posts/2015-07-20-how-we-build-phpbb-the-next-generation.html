<p>This month's meeting will take place on <strong>Monday 20th July, 7pm for 7.15pm start<&#47;strong>, at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theskiff.org&#47;">The Skiff<&#47;a> in Brighton as usual. This month we welcome <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;michaelcullumuk">Michael Cullum<&#47;a> to present to the group on "How we build phpBB: The Next Generation":<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>
phpBB is a forum software that has been around since 2000 and is possibly one of the oldest still developed and widely used FOSS [Free & Open Source Software] projects around. In 2007, phpBB 3.0 &lsquo;Olympus&rsquo; was released, and since then we have embarked on an adventure for the next major release of phpBB &ndash; 3.1 (also called 3.2 and 4.0 in the past). This talk goes over where phpBB has come from since the Olympus release, the mistakes we&rsquo;ve made, and finally how we made it to making 3.1 a finished product, built using Symfony Components. As a part of this, I will outline the different development workflows & release cycles we&rsquo;ve tried and go over what worked and what didn&rsquo;t in order to help prevent you from making the same mistakes.<br />
