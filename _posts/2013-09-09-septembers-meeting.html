Jakub is one of the first few certified Symfony developers. Being focused on the code quality he's a big enthusiast of behaviour driven development. He's also an active member of the Symfony community sending pull requests, writing documentation and promoting Symfony and BDD&#47;Behat on local meetings. In his spare time Jakub blogs on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zalas.eu">www.zalas.eu<&#47;a>. You can also find him on twitter: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;jakub_zalas">@jakub_zalas<&#47;a><&#47;p></p>
<p>Jakub will be presenting "<strong>Building the quality in<&#47;strong>":<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>
Agile methodologies are very popular these days. Writing user stories with acceptance criteria, standup meetings and other agile ceremonies are nothing new to the most of us.</p>
<p>Going one step further and automating the acceptance criteria with tools like Behat, improves the outer quality of the software we write, by focusing the development on the business goals from the very beginning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tools like PhpSpec aim to ensure the inner quality of code, supporting the developer at every step by almost suggesting next actions to take.</p>
<p>During the talk Jakub will present development practices for developers focused on building quality into the application with a test-first approach.<br />

<p>The meeting will be Monday 16th September, 7pm for 7.15pm start, at The Skiff as usual.  Please sign up on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lanyrd.com&#47;2013&#47;brightonphp-september&#47;">Lanyrd<&#47;a> if you're thinking of attending :-)<&#47;p></p>
