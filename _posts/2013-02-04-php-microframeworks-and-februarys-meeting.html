<p>A belated happy new year! January's meeting took place on the 21st Jan at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;theskiff.org">The Skiff<&#47;a>, where we had a presentation by <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;galide">Emmanuel Ide<&#47;a> on the state of PHP microframeworks.  Emmanuel started off by giving us some background on frameworks within PHP and then moved onto the requirement for a micro framework.  He covered some code examples including some from a real-world application, and then rounded off with some pointers to further information, and a good Q&A at the end.</p>
<p>If you're interested, Emmanuel's slides are available over at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.slideshare.net&#47;galide&#47;microframeworks">Slideshare<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Following the meeting we headed to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.drinkinbrighton.co.uk&#47;north-laine">The North Laine<&#47;a> pub&#47;microbrewery a few doors down from the venue.  It was good to see a few new faces this month also!</p>
<p>February's presentation will take place on Monday 18th February 2013, again at The Skiff.  This month we're joined by the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;groups.drupal.org&#47;brighton">Drupal Brighton<&#47;a> members, who'll present a few talks on Drupal and the project's current status and direction, why people have moved to Drupal from vanilla PHP&#47;MySQL and similar talks.  This should be a great set of presentations!  Following the presentation and discussions, we'll head to the pub.</p>
