<blockquote><p>All aboard as we travel from London to Chicago! These two historical methods approach unit testing from divergent perspectives. During our voyage, we'll explore each style's philosophy; not only how they test, but how they view testing, what they test and why. We'll discuss the merits of the approaches and how to implement each style. Finally, we'll develop a conceptual model for integrating other resources encountered along your testing journey.<&#47;blockquote></p>
