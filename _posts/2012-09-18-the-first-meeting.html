<p>So after a positive response from people regarding the usefulness of the group, I'm happy to announce the first meeting of BrightonPHP! &nbsp;The kickoff meeting will be on:</p>
<p><strong>Monday 15th October, 7pm onwards, at the Friends Centre in Brighton.<&#47;strong></p>
<p>We've got a room booked from 7pm-9pm there. &nbsp;The idea is to see what people want from the group in terms of presentations, technical level and so on, to decide how to take things forward really. &nbsp;Following the meeting, the plan is to adjourn to a nearby pub for a few drinks if anyone's interested :-)</p>
<p>The Friends Centre is located behind Brighton Station - it's termed "Brighton Junction" on their website. &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.friendscentre.org&#47;template.php?page=find-us.html">Directions<&#47;a> are available on their site.</p>
<p>Please pass this on to anyone you think might be interested, and hope to see you all there :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
