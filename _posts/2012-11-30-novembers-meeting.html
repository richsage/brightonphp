<p>On the 19th November, we had our first "normal" meeting, for want of a better term! The meeting kicked off a little after 7pm, at our new venue at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theskiff.org&#47;">The Skiff<&#47;a> in Brighton. Karim Ahmed from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sweetcode.co.uk&#47;">Sweet Code<&#47;a> presented about "Profiling for Performance" and demonstrated some of the tools available to profile your application's database queries and for debugging your PHP applications. Following the presentation, we headed to a nearby pub for drinks. Thanks to Karim for the presentation!</p>
<p>Our next meeting is <strong>17th December<&#47;strong>, again at The Skiff, and kicking off at 7pm. We're currently looking for a talk&#47;presentation for this meeting - if you're interested, shout over @brightonphp or drop an email to rich@brightonphp.org :-)</p>
