<blockquote><p>"It works on my box". "I don't have a day to help Dave set up his new PC". "I swear I had the same version installed!"</p>
<p>Sound familiar? It was for me too before I started using Vagrant and Ansible.</p>
<p>Vagrant is a tool for automating the creation of virtual machines. Of course, that's only half of the battle - once you have a machine you need to configure it. That's where Ansible comes in.</p>
<p>Ansible is a powerful server automation tool (think Puppet or Chef, but with a *much* lower learning curve), allowing you to install software and configure things as you need in a reproducible way.</p>
<p>By the end of this talk, everyone will be able to go home and create a Vagrant box that installs PHP, Apache2 and configures an example website with a custom VirtualHost in under 30 minutes.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Michael's biography:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>Michael is a fixer, working mainly with with PHP&#47;NodeJS&#47;MySQL and doing bits of server administration on the side, he goes where things need working on.</p>
<p>Currently, he's a member of the platform team at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;datasift.com&#47;" target="_self">Datasift<&#47;a>, working as part of a team that processes and augments various incoming data sources (including the Twitter firehose) before redistributing it to customers.<&#47;blockquote><br />
