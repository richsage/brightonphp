<p>This month we're excited to welcome <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;dshafik">Davey Shafik<&#47;a>, a Community Engineer at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.engineyard.com&#47;">Engine Yard<&#47;a> and a well-known member of the PHP community.  Davey will present <strong>"PHP: Under The Hood"<&#47;strong>, streamed live via the magic of the internet!<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote><p>Performance issues can be caused by many things, from database interactions, web services, disk i&#47;o and, less frequently, the code itself.<br />
We would typically turn to a profiler like xhprof to diagnose these issues, but what if the bottleneck is PHP itself, where do you turn?<br />
This talk will take that inspection a step further and look under the hood of PHP, at the C internals of how things tick.<br />
This talk covers what every PHP developer should know about their tools &mdash; like what's really going on when you use double quotes vs single quotes.<br />
If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to know exactly what your code is doing, and why ++$i is faster than $i++, this talk is for you.<br />
Note: This is an advanced talk, you should be extremely familiar with PHP and have some experience with profiling if you are to get the most from this talk.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>This promises to be a great talk, and EngineYard have also kindly donated some free swag to give away - currently in transit at the moment from the USA!<&#47;p></p>
<p>As usual, our meeting is on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lanyrd.com&#47;2014&#47;brightonphp-july&#47;">Lanyrd<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;joind.in&#47;event&#47;brightonphp-july-2014">joind.in<&#47;a> - please mark yourselves as attending if you're thinking of coming :-)<&#47;p></p>
